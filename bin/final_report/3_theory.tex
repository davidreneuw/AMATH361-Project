% explain what waves exist in seismology
Two particular types of waves in seismology are known as $p$-waves and $s$-waves. The distinction between the types draws from the direction in which the wave displaces the field relative to the wave's direction of travel. \cite[57]{stein2009introduction}.

An $s$-wave displaces the field in a direction orthogonal to the propagation of the wave. This is also known as a \textit{transverse wave}.
On the other hand, a $p$-wave displaces the field in the same direction as the propagation of the wave. This is also known as a \textit{longitudinal wave}\cite[57]{stein2009introduction}.



%All waves have a particular direction of travel--the vector along which the wave itself propagates. In addition to this, the wave also has another vector of interest: the direction in which the wave's field is

As expected, the Earth is not an isotropic material.
